# Pendulum_PID_Controller
In this repository, I tried to make the pendulum's pid controller in matlab. The PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller aims to keep the pendulum in a desired position or angle by adjusting a control input (usually a motor or a force) based on the error between the desired position and the actual position of the pendulum.
