# Pendulum_PID_Controller
In this repository&lt; I tried to make the pendulum's pid controller in matlab. The PID controller aims to keep the pendulum in a desired position or angle by adjusting a control input (usually a motor or a force) based on the error between the desired position and the actual position of the pendulum.
